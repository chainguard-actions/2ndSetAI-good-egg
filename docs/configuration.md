# Configuration Reference

Good Egg is configured via a YAML file, environment variables, or
programmatically through the `GoodEggConfig` class.

## Configuration File

Place a `.good-egg.yml` file in your repository root. The GitHub Action
auto-detects this file; for the CLI, pass `--config` to the `score`
subcommand:

```bash
good-egg score <username> --repo owner/name --config .good-egg.yml
```

See [examples/.good-egg.yml](../examples/.good-egg.yml) for a complete
example with all defaults.

## Config Precedence

Configuration values are resolved in this order (highest priority first):

1. **CLI arguments** (e.g. `--token`)
2. **Environment variables** (e.g. `GOOD_EGG_ALPHA`)
3. **YAML config file**
4. **Built-in defaults**

## Scoring Model

Good Egg supports three scoring models. Set the model at the top level of
the config file:

```yaml
scoring_model: v3   # default -- Diet Egg -- alltime merge rate as sole signal
scoring_model: v2   # Better Egg -- graph + external features via logistic regression
scoring_model: v1   # Good Egg -- graph-based scoring only
```

PR comments are branded "Diet Egg", "Better Egg", or "Good Egg" depending
on the model. See [methodology.md](methodology.md) for how each model
works.

## Config Sections

### scoring_model

Selects the scoring model. `v3` (default, Diet Egg) uses alltime merge rate
as the sole signal with no graph construction. `v2` (Better Egg) combines a
simplified graph score with merge rate and account age via logistic
regression. `v1` (Good Egg) uses graph-based scoring only.

When set to `v2`, the parameters under the `v2:` block are used and the
graph construction is simplified (no self-contribution penalty, no language
normalization in repo quality, no diversity/volume adjustment). Language
match personalization weighting (`same_language_weight`) is retained in v2.

v3 does not use graph construction, so the `graph_scoring`, `recency`,
`edge_weights`, and `language_normalization` sections have no effect. The
`thresholds` section still controls trust level classification.

### v2 (Better Egg)

Configuration for the Better Egg (v2) scoring model. This section is only
used when `scoring_model` is set to `v2`.

- **`v2.graph`** -- Graph construction parameters for the simplified v2 graph.
  Supports `half_life_days`, `max_age_days`, `archived_penalty`, and
  `fork_penalty`. Note that v2 shares graph algorithm parameters (`alpha`,
  `max_iterations`, `tolerance`) with the top-level `graph_scoring` config.
- **`v2.features`** -- Toggle external features on or off. `merge_rate`
  (merged/(merged+closed)) and `account_age` (log-transformed days) are both
  enabled by default.
- **`v2.combined_model`** -- Logistic regression coefficients. The final
  score is `sigmoid(intercept + graph_score_weight * graph_score +
  merge_rate_weight * merge_rate + account_age_weight *
  log(account_age_days + 1))`.

### skip_known_contributors

When `true` (the default), Good Egg performs a lightweight pre-check before
running the full scoring pipeline. If the PR author already has merged pull
requests in the target repository, scoring is skipped and the trust level is
set to `EXISTING_CONTRIBUTOR`. Set to `false` to always run full scoring.

### graph_scoring

Controls the graph-based scoring algorithm. The `alpha` parameter is the
damping factor -- higher values give more weight to the structure of the
contribution graph. The `context_repo_weight` and `same_language_weight`
parameters control how much the context repository and same-language
repositories influence the score.

### thresholds

Defines the boundaries between trust levels. A normalized score at or
above `high_trust` maps to HIGH, at or above `medium_trust` maps to MEDIUM,
and below that maps to LOW. Accounts younger than `new_account_days` are
flagged.

### recency

Controls how recent contributions are weighted relative to older ones.
`half_life_days` sets the exponential decay half-life; contributions at
that age carry half the weight of new ones. `max_age_days` sets a hard
cutoff -- older PRs are ignored entirely.

### edge_weights

Multipliers for different types of contributions. These affect the edge
weights in the contribution graph.

### fetch

Controls how much data is retrieved from the GitHub API per user. Reducing
`max_prs` lowers API usage at the cost of less data for scoring.

### cache_ttl

Time-to-live for cached GitHub API responses. The cache avoids refetching
data that has not changed.

### language_normalization

Adjusts contribution weights by language ecosystem size. Languages with
smaller ecosystems (fewer repositories on GitHub) get higher multipliers so
that contributions to niche projects are not undervalued.

## Environment Variable Overrides

The following environment variables override individual config values:

| Variable | Config Path | Type |
|----------|-------------|------|
| `GOOD_EGG_ALPHA` | `graph_scoring.alpha` | float |
| `GOOD_EGG_OTHER_WEIGHT` | `graph_scoring.other_weight` | float |
| `GOOD_EGG_DIVERSITY_SCALE` | `graph_scoring.diversity_scale` | float |
| `GOOD_EGG_VOLUME_SCALE` | `graph_scoring.volume_scale` | float |
| `GOOD_EGG_MAX_PRS` | `fetch.max_prs` | int |
| `GOOD_EGG_HIGH_TRUST` | `thresholds.high_trust` | float |
| `GOOD_EGG_MEDIUM_TRUST` | `thresholds.medium_trust` | float |
| `GOOD_EGG_HALF_LIFE_DAYS` | `recency.half_life_days` | int |
| `GOOD_EGG_SCORING_MODEL` | `scoring_model` | str (`v1`, `v2`, or `v3`) |
| `GOOD_EGG_SKIP_KNOWN_CONTRIBUTORS` | `skip_known_contributors` | bool (`true`/`false`) |

## Programmatic Configuration

In Python, create a `GoodEggConfig` directly:

```python
from good_egg import GoodEggConfig

config = GoodEggConfig(
    thresholds={"high_trust": 0.8, "medium_trust": 0.4},
    graph_scoring={"alpha": 0.9},
)
```

Or load from a YAML file:

```python
from good_egg.config import load_config

config = load_config(".good-egg.yml")
```

The `GoodEggConfig` class is composed of the following sub-configs:
`GraphScoringConfig`, `EdgeWeightConfig`, `RecencyConfig`,
`ThresholdConfig`, `CacheTTLConfig`, `LanguageNormalization`,
`FetchConfig`, and (for v2) `V2Config`.
